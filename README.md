# Todo

This application is a demo application that demonstrates using Ecto
with Elixir outside of Phoenix. This is the code that I wrote while
preparing for my talk at the San Diego Elixir Meetup on July 21, 2016.

The majority of this was then live-coded. Just looking at the code will
not give you the whole feel of the talk nor the meat of what we did
in that session.

If you are cloning this for the sake of following along, note that there
will very likely be changes/differences between what is in this repo and
the final form of the live-coded application.

I've tried to make each commit comment provide details as to what
we then did with the changes in that commit. Again, I've likely missed
some things as they are taken from my notes I used during the presentation.

If you see anything wrong, please let me know. Thanks!
